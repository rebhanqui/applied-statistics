A person claims they have the special power of being able to tell whether the tea or the milk went into a cup first upon tasting it. You agree to accept their claim if they can tell which of the six cups in your experiment had the milk in first.\n",

Once they select the six cups they think had the milk in first, you will give them the benefit of the doubt should they have selected at least five of the correct cups.
